# RideShare Application

## Project Overview
The RideShare application is an AI-powered platform developed to enhance commuting for Hexaware employees by connecting individuals with similar travel routes and schedules. The application promotes cost savings, sustainability, and workplace connectivity through ride-sharing.

## Objectives
- **Cost Reduction**: Minimize commuting expenses by sharing rides.
- **Employee Connectivity**: Foster networking and collaboration during commutes.
- **Sustainable Commuting**: Reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion.
- **Safety and Convenience**: Offer secure, AI-driven ride matching with real-time tracking.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login using corporate credentials.
- **AI-Powered Ride Matching**: Matches riders and drivers based on route and time preferences.
- **Ride Scheduling**: Flexible scheduling for both immediate and future rides.
- **Cashless Transactions**: Automatic fare calculation and secure payments.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Updates on ride confirmations, cancellations, and statuses.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Database, Hosting)

## AI-Powered Algorithms
- **Ride Matching Algorithm**: Matches riders and drivers by comparing routes and schedules.
- **Route Optimization Algorithm**: Dynamically optimizes routes for multiple riders.
- **Payment Calculation Algorithm**: Automatically splits ride costs based on distance.
- **Notification Algorithm**: Real-time alerts for ride status and updates.
- **Feedback Analysis Algorithm**: Analyzes feedback to improve user experience.

## Notification Services
- **Types of Notifications**: Ride requests, status updates, payment receipts, and feedback requests.
- **Delivery Channels**: Push notifications, email, and SMS.

## Document Generation
- **Invoices**: Detailed ride fare breakdowns.
- **Trip Sheets**: Summaries for drivers with rider details and route information.
- **Reports**: Daily and monthly reports for ride activity and feedback.
