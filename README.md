## AI Algorithms

### Ride Matching Algorithm
This algorithm intelligently pairs riders and drivers by analyzing:
- **Destination Matching**: Ensuring the rider and driver are headed in the same direction.
- **Time Preferences**: Matching users with similar schedules for seamless coordination.
- **Historical Data**: Learning from past ride data to improve matching accuracy over time.



### Route Optimization Algorithm
Designed to minimize travel time and distance, this algorithm:
- **Optimizes Multi-Stop Routes**: Adjusts routes to efficiently accommodate multiple riders.
- **Reduces Travel Time**: Ensures the most efficient route is selected, reducing delays.



### Payment Calculation Algorithm
The app automatically calculates and splits the fare among riders:
- **Distance-Based Calculation**: Each rider pays proportionally based on the distance traveled.
